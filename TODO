1. Yong-Wei Wu suggested to use mapping inside Microsoft Word
   (Simplified Chinese Version)
2. I have tried, but there are still some mapping which cannot
   be resolved in both current Encode::CNMap version and
   Microsoft mappings.
3. I consider to write a perl utility to compare GBK and GB2312
   ucm files in detail, in order to find out exactly key diffs
   and to provides mappings such as 蹚(GBK)->趟(GB2312).

I am busy this week and next week. :(
